Background
==========
Samsungs Galaxy S series comes preinstalled with 'minidiary' a simple diary
(which I used to make simple diary entries).

When I flashed my Galaxy S to a recent ICS update, this app stopped working
mainly because it was depending on the Samsungs Touchwiz libraries. This really
sucked. At the android market I found another great diary 'memoires', it seemed
to use sqlite as it storage and supported backup/restore as zipfiles containing
the sqlite database and images.

So I started making an import/convertor of the minidiary entries to the new
memories diary entries.

Script is tested on my personal diary containing about 500 entries and about 
400 pictures.

Prerequisites
=============
perl
perl-dbi
perl-dbd-sqlite
imagemagick
zip

How to use it
=============
WARNING: this will create an empty Memoires database! (so if you used Memoires
before that data will be removed)

1) Backup your minidiary database

You can find it on your galaxy S in 
/dbdata/databases/com.sec.android.app.minidiary/mini_diary.db

It can be quite big, because apparently it stores pictures 4 times (although as
different sizes) in this database.
(You can use something like Titanium Backup or just cp or tar to make the
backup) 

2) Put the mini_diary.db in the 'input' directory

3) Run minidiary2memoires.sh this will give output like below

./minidiary2memoires.sh
creating basic memoires database
reading minidiary database, extracting images and creating sqlimport script
creating thumb images

copy tmp/memoires_backup.1.zip to your sdcard (/sdcard/backups/memoires/)


4) copy the memoires_backup.1.zip to your android device (to /sdcard/backups/memoires)

5) Start Memories - import/export - restore from backup - select
memoires_backup.1.zip
